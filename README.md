# Purpose

This project was created for the conclusion work of Information Systems course at the UFF college (Universidade Federal Fluminense - RJ/Brazil).

# What is our goal?

With this work, we intend to teach Information Security to everyone who is interested.

The game is based on levels, from basic to advanced, and in each level, you will find content of some concept and a game at the end to apply what you have learned.
