This project was created for the conclusion work of Information Systems course at the UFF college (Universidade Federal Fluminense - RJ/Brazil).

Flutter/Dart language used.

With this work, we intend to teach Information Security to everyone who is interested.

The game is based on levels, from basic to advanced, and in each level, you will find content of some concept and a game at the end to apply what you have learned.

This project was started with Flutter Casual Games Toolkit. 

Hope you all enjoy!! =D =D
